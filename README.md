Open the .ipynb to see the commented solution of the assigned exercises. 
The exercises are complementary to the theoretical course of Statistical Mechanics.

Here's a list of the exercises with a brief comment on what they are about:
- Ex01:
	Generating random numbers with different profile distributions and testing the poissonian limit of exponential distributed events        
- Ex02: 
        Implement n-dimensional Random walks and verify that the number of returns to the origin diverges only for dimensions <=2
	Implement a 2-D Self Avoiding Random walk generator through the Pivot algorithm (Monte Carlo method)
- Ex03: 
        
- Ex04: 
        
- Ex05:
